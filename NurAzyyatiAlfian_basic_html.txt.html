	<p><i>Education is defined as studying in order to obtain a deeper knowledge and understanding of a variety of subjects to be applied to daily life. It is not limited to just knowledge from books, but can also be obtained through practical experiences outside of the classroom.</p></i>

	<p><i>There are many different understandings of what education is, but one thing can be universally agreed upon, which is the importance of education. For example, it is importance to provide stability, provides financial security, needed for equality, allows for self-dependency, making your dreams come true, having a safer world, confidence, and many more.</p></i>

	<p><i>There is an impact education has on the world. With education, people can become better citizens, knowing right from wrong, allowing for a better society where laws are followed. An educated nation knows about the importance of voting, doing so with the knowledge not blindly, but also having an understanding of what their party truly stands for.</p></i>
